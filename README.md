# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

A lot of this project is designed with simplicity in mind, (which is appreciated from a students perspective), but with that said changes to this website i would probably make if it were for a real business/client:

1. Each section would probably be seperated by links instead of all on one page.
2. The recipes section wouldn't exist.
3. The style of the menu is super bland, white background with an image and pretty plain text style.
4. The about section and footer apear to be one section, so I personally would alter the color transition to be more apparent.
